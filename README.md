# Matroidal-Connectivity
BCube DCNs

The source codes for simulations of the paper "Link/Switch Failure Analysis of Data Center Networks on Matroidal Connectivity".

LFR.py and SFR.py aim to measure the range of link and switch failures in different matroidal constraint situations \mathcal{B}_m, respectively.
