# Matroidal-Connectivity
BCube DCNs

The source codes for simulations of the paper "Link/Switch Failure Analysis of Data Center Networks on Matroidal Connectivity".

LBCube.py defines the logic graph of BCube (see Definition 2). BCube.py constructs the physical structure of BCube DCNs (see Definition 1).

Algorithm1.py is designed to verify whether a given faulty edge set is a minimum edge cut to meet the conditional matroidal connectivity.

LFR.py and SFR.py aim to measure the range of link and switch failures in different matroidal constraint situations \mathcal{B}_m, respectively (see Section V-A).
